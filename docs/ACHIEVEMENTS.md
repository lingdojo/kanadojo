## Technical Implementation

### Store Structure

The achievement system uses Zustand for state management with the following key components:

```typescript
interface AchievementState {
  unlockedAchievements: Record<string, Achievement>;
  notifications: AchievementNotification[];
  totalPoints: number;
  level: number;
  // ... methods
}
```

### Integration Points

1. **Stats Integration** - Automatically checks for achievements when stats update
2. **Game Flow** - Triggers achievement checks after correct/incorrect answers
3. **Session Completion** - Checks achievements when training sessions end
4. **Persistent Storage** - Saves achievement progress locally

### Components

#### Core Components
- `AchievementModal` - Full-screen celebration modal
- `AchievementNotification` - In-app notification system
- `AchievementProgress` - Progress tracking page
- `AchievementBadge` - Navigation badge with notifications

#### Settings & Management
- `AchievementSettings` - Management interface in preferences
- Export/Import functionality for achievement data
- Reset options with confirmation

### Hooks

- `useAchievements` - Main hook for achievement integration
- `useAchievementTrigger` - Trigger achievement checks manually
- Integration with existing `useStats` hook

## Usage

### Adding New Achievements

1. Add achievement definition to `ACHIEVEMENTS` array in `store/useAchievementStore.ts`
2. Define achievement requirements and metadata
3. Achievements are automatically checked based on requirements

```typescript
{
  id: 'new_achievement',
  title: 'Achievement Title',
  description: 'Achievement description',
  icon: 'üéØ',
  rarity: 'rare',
  points: 100,
  category: 'milestone',
  requirements: { type: 'total_correct', value: 1000 }
}
```

### Triggering Achievement Checks

Achievement checks are automatically triggered:
- After correct/incorrect answers
- When sessions are saved
- When stats are updated

Manual triggering:
```typescript
const { triggerAchievementCheck } = useAchievementTrigger();
const newAchievements = triggerAchievementCheck();
```

### Displaying Achievement Status

```typescript
const { totalPoints, level, unlockedCount, hasUnseenNotifications } = useAchievements();
```

```

  useAchievementStore.ts          # Main achievement store

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Achievements not unlocking** - Check if stats are properly updating
2. **Notifications not showing** - Verify notification container is mounted

### Debug Tools

- Achievement recalculation in settings
- Export/import for data backup
- Console logging for development

## Contributing

When adding new achievements:
1. Follow existing naming conventions
2. Use appropriate rarity levels
3. Test achievement triggers thoroughly
4. Update documentation
5. Consider performance impact

The achievement system is designed to be extensible and maintainable, encouraging continued learning and engagement with the KanaDojo platform.
