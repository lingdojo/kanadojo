# 📋 How to Create README Translation Issues

## 🎯 Task Completed

I've prepared comprehensive templates for creating **4 GitHub issues** to translate the README.md file into:

1. 🇫🇷 **French (France)** → `README.fr-fr.md`
2. 🇪🇸 **Spanish (Spain)** → `README.es-es.md`
3. 🇨🇳 **Chinese (Simplified)** → `README.zh-cn.md`
4. 🇩🇪 **German (Germany)** → `README.de-de.md`

## ⚠️ Why Can't I Create Issues Directly?

As an AI assistant in this environment, I cannot:
- Create GitHub issues directly (no GitHub API credentials)
- Update issues or PRs
- Access the GitHub Issues interface

However, I've created detailed templates that make it very easy for you to create these issues manually!

## 📁 Files Created

### 1. `TRANSLATION_ISSUES.md` (Main File)
- **292 lines** of comprehensive issue templates
- Contains all 4 complete issue templates ready to copy-paste
- Includes titles, descriptions, acceptance criteria, and guidelines
- Tailored to each language's specific requirements

### 2. `CREATE_TRANSLATION_ISSUES.md` (Instructions)
- **102 lines** of step-by-step instructions
- Manual creation steps via GitHub UI
- GitHub CLI commands (if you have CLI access)
- Tips for issue management and tracking

### 3. `TRANSLATION_ISSUES_SUMMARY.md` (Context)
- **147 lines** explaining the complete context
- Why these languages were chosen
- Quality standards expected
- Translation progress tracking suggestions

## 🚀 Quick Start: Create the Issues Now

### Option A: Copy-Paste Method (5 minutes)

1. Open https://github.com/lingdojo/kanadojo/issues
2. Click **"New Issue"**
3. Open `TRANSLATION_ISSUES.md` in this repository
4. Copy the content for **Issue 1** (French):
   - **Title**: `Translate README to French (France)`
   - **Body**: Everything under "Description:" for Issue 1
5. Add labels: `documentation`, `translation`, `help wanted`, `good first issue`
6. Click **"Submit new issue"**
7. Repeat steps 2-6 for Issues 2, 3, and 4

### Option B: GitHub CLI Method (1 minute)

If you have `gh` CLI installed and authenticated:

```bash
cd /home/runner/work/kanadojo/kanadojo

# Extract and create each issue
gh issue create \
  --title "Translate README to French (France)" \
  --label "documentation,translation,help wanted,good first issue" \
  --body "$(sed -n '/### 📝 Description/,/^## Issue 2/p' TRANSLATION_ISSUES.md | head -n -2)"

gh issue create \
  --title "Translate README to Spanish (Spain)" \
  --label "documentation,translation,help wanted,good first issue" \
  --body "$(sed -n '/## Issue 2/,/^## Issue 3/p' TRANSLATION_ISSUES.md | grep -A 1000 '### 📝 Description' | head -n -2)"

gh issue create \
  --title "Translate README to Chinese (Simplified)" \
  --label "documentation,translation,help wanted,good first issue" \
  --body "$(sed -n '/## Issue 3/,/^## Issue 4/p' TRANSLATION_ISSUES.md | grep -A 1000 '### 📝 Description' | head -n -2)"

gh issue create \
  --title "Translate README to German (Germany)" \
  --label "documentation,translation,help wanted,good first issue" \
  --body "$(sed -n '/## Issue 4/,/^## 📌/p' TRANSLATION_ISSUES.md | grep -A 1000 '### 📝 Description' | head -n -2)"
```

## ✅ What Each Issue Contains

Every issue template includes:

### 📝 Clear Description
- Why the translation is needed
- Target audience (French/Spanish/Chinese/German speakers)

### 🎯 Specific Goal
- File name to create (e.g., `README.fr-fr.md`)
- Reference to existing translation example

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria (Checklist)
- [ ] Create the file with correct naming
- [ ] Translate all content
- [ ] Preserve formatting
- [ ] Keep code and technical terms unchanged
- [ ] Maintain structure
- [ ] Cultural appropriateness

### 📋 Sections to Translate
Complete list of all README sections that need translation

### 💡 Language-Specific Guidelines
- **French**: Formal vs informal, French typography rules
- **Spanish**: Peninsular Spanish specifics, inverted punctuation
- **Chinese**: Simplified characters, Chinese punctuation, transliteration
- **German**: Noun capitalization, formal vs informal, compound words

### 🔗 References

## 🏷️ Suggested Labels

Add these labels to each issue:
- `documentation` - It's a documentation task
- `translation` - Specific translation work
- `help wanted` - Community help is welcome
- `good first issue` - Great for new contributors

## 📊 After Creating the Issues

Consider these next steps:

1. **Pin the issues** - Make them visible on the repository front page
2. **Create a milestone** - "Internationalization" or "v1.0 Translations"
3. **Project board** - Track translation progress visually
4. **Announce** - Share in your community channels
5. **Social media** - Tweet/post to attract translators

## 🌍 Why These 4 Languages?

- **French**: Large European audience, significant Japanese learner community
- **Spanish**: Major world language, growing interest in Japanese culture
- **Chinese**: Geographically close to Japan, many learners
- **German**: Strong European market, high interest in Japanese language

## 📈 Expected Impact

Once these translations are completed:
- ✅ README accessible in **6 languages** (English, Portuguese, + 4 new)
- ✅ Broader international appeal
- ✅ More contributors from diverse backgrounds
- ✅ Demonstrates commitment to accessibility
- ✅ Sets foundation for more translations

## 📞 Need Help?

If you encounter any issues creating these GitHub issues:
1. Check the GitHub documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/issues
2. Verify you have permissions to create issues in the repository
3. Ensure you're signed in to GitHub
4. Try using the GitHub CLI if the web interface has issues

## 🗑️ Clean Up (Optional)

After creating all 4 issues, you may optionally delete these helper files:
- `CREATE_TRANSLATION_ISSUES.md`
- `TRANSLATION_ISSUES_SUMMARY.md`
- `HOW_TO_CREATE_ISSUES.md` (this file)

Keep `TRANSLATION_ISSUES.md` as reference for the issues you created, or delete it too once issues are created.
