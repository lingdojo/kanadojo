# 🚀 START HERE: README Translation Issues

## 📌 Quick Summary

I've prepared **complete templates** for creating **4 GitHub issues** to translate the KanaDojo README into:

| Language | File Name | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| 🇫🇷 French (France) | `README.fr-fr.md` | ⏳ Issue needs to be created |
| 🇪🇸 Spanish (Spain) | `README.es-es.md` | ⏳ Issue needs to be created |
| 🇨🇳 Chinese (Simplified) | `README.zh-cn.md` | ⏳ Issue needs to be created |
| 🇩🇪 German (Germany) | `README.de-de.md` | ⏳ Issue needs to be created |

## ⚡ What You Need to Do (Choose One Option)

### Option 1: Quick Copy-Paste (5 minutes) ⭐ RECOMMENDED

1. Go to: https://github.com/lingdojo/kanadojo/issues/new
2. Open `TRANSLATION_ISSUES.md` in this repo
3. Copy the title and description for **Issue 1** (French)
4. Paste into GitHub's new issue form
5. Add labels: `documentation`, `translation`, `help wanted`, `good first issue`
6. Submit the issue
7. Repeat for Issues 2, 3, and 4

**Detailed instructions:** See `HOW_TO_CREATE_ISSUES.md`

### Option 2: Use GitHub CLI (1 minute)

If you have `gh` CLI installed:

```bash
# Run these commands from the repository root
gh issue create --title "Translate README to French (France)" \
  --label "documentation,translation,help wanted,good first issue" \
  --body "$(cat TRANSLATION_ISSUES.md | sed -n '/## Issue 1/,/## Issue 2/p')"

gh issue create --title "Translate README to Spanish (Spain)" \
  --label "documentation,translation,help wanted,good first issue" \
  --body "$(cat TRANSLATION_ISSUES.md | sed -n '/## Issue 2/,/## Issue 3/p')"

gh issue create --title "Translate README to Chinese (Simplified)" \
  --label "documentation,translation,help wanted,good first issue" \
  --body "$(cat TRANSLATION_ISSUES.md | sed -n '/## Issue 3/,/## Issue 4/p')"

gh issue create --title "Translate README to German (Germany)" \
  --label "documentation,translation,help wanted,good first issue" \
  --body "$(cat TRANSLATION_ISSUES.md | sed -n '/## Issue 4/,/## 📌/p')"
```

## ❓ Why Can't the AI Create Issues Directly?

Due to environment limitations, I cannot:
- ❌ Access GitHub API with credentials
- ❌ Create, update, or close issues
- ❌ Modify the repository's issue tracker

But I CAN (and did):
- ✅ Create comprehensive issue templates
- ✅ Provide detailed guidelines for each language
- ✅ Write instructions for issue creation
- ✅ Make it very easy for you to create them!

## 🎯 What Each Issue Contains

Every issue template includes:

✅ **Clear title** - Language and target file  
✅ **Description** - Why the translation is needed  
✅ **Goal** - What to create and how  
✅ **Acceptance criteria** - Complete checklist  
✅ **Sections list** - All parts to translate  
✅ **Language guidelines** - Specific to each language  
✅ **References** - Links to original README and examples  
✅ **Contributor notes** - Encouragement and tips  
✅ **Suggested labels** - For proper categorization  

## 📖 Quick Reference

### Issue Titles (Copy These)
```
