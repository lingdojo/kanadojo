# README Translation Issues - Summary

## üéØ Objective

Create separate GitHub issues for translating the README.md file into:
1. French (France) ‚Üí `README.fr-fr.md`
2. Spanish (Spain) ‚Üí `README.es-es.md`
3. Chinese (Simplified) ‚Üí `README.zh-cn.md`
4. German (Germany) ‚Üí `README.de-de.md`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Limitation

**I cannot create GitHub issues directly** due to environment limitations. The GitHub API credentials required for creating issues are not available in this sandboxed environment.

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Completed

I have created comprehensive documentation to facilitate the creation of these issues:

### 1. **TRANSLATION_ISSUES.md**
This file contains complete, ready-to-use templates for all 4 translation issues, including:
- Issue titles
- Detailed descriptions
- Acceptance criteria (checklists)
- Translation guidelines specific to each language
- Cultural and linguistic considerations
- References to existing files
- Notes for contributors

### 2. **CREATE_TRANSLATION_ISSUES.md**
This file provides step-by-step instructions for creating the issues, including:
- Manual creation steps via GitHub web interface
- GitHub CLI commands (if available)
- GitHub API reference
- Issue management tips
- Quality checklist

### 3. **Translation Naming Convention**
Following the existing pattern from `README.pt-br.md`, the new translations will use:
- `README.fr-fr.md` for French (France)
- `README.es-es.md` for Spanish (Spain)
- `README.zh-cn.md` for Chinese (Simplified)
- `README.de-de.md` for German (Germany)

## üìã Each Issue Template Includes

### Common Elements for All Languages:
- ‚úÖ Clear title and description
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive acceptance criteria
- ‚úÖ List of sections to translate
- ‚úÖ Translation guidelines
- ‚úÖ References to original and example files
- ‚úÖ Notes for contributors
- ‚úÖ Suggested labels: `documentation`, `translation`, `help wanted`, `good first issue`

### Language-Specific Considerations:

**French (France):**
- Guidance on formal vs informal address ("vous" vs "tu")
- French typography rules (spacing before punctuation)
- Cultural appropriateness

**Spanish (Spain):**
- Peninsular Spanish vs Latin American Spanish distinctions
- Informal "t√∫" vs formal "usted"
- Inverted punctuation marks (¬ø? ¬°!)

**Chinese (Simplified):**
- Simplified vs Traditional characters guidance
- Chinese punctuation rules
- Transliteration of technical terms
- Pinyin considerations

**German (Germany):**
- Noun capitalization rules
- Informal "du" vs formal "Sie"
- German compound words
- Cultural adaptation

## üöÄ Next Steps (Manual Action Required)

To complete this task, you need to:

1. **Open the repository on GitHub** (https://github.com/lingdojo/kanadojo)
2. **Navigate to Issues tab**
3. **Create 4 new issues** using the content from `TRANSLATION_ISSUES.md`:
   - Copy the title for each issue
   - Copy the description for each issue
   - Add the suggested labels
   - Submit each issue

### Quick Option: GitHub CLI

If you have GitHub CLI installed and authenticated, you can run the commands provided in `CREATE_TRANSLATION_ISSUES.md` to create all 4 issues quickly.

## üìä Translation Progress Tracking

Once issues are created, consider:
- Creating a "Translations" or "Internationalization" milestone
- Setting up a project board to track translation progress
- Pinning the translation issues for visibility
- Encouraging community participation with "good first issue" label

## üåç Why These Languages?

These languages were selected based on:
- Geographic diversity (Europe, Asia, South America already covered with Portuguese)
- Large populations of Japanese language learners
- Active open-source communities
- Complement to existing Portuguese (Brazil) translation

## üìù Quality Standards

Each translation should:
- Maintain the same structure and formatting as the original
- Preserve all technical terms, code blocks, and links
- Be culturally appropriate for the target audience
- Read naturally for native speakers
- Maintain technical accuracy
- Keep Japanese text unchanged (Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji)

## ü§ù Community Contribution

These translations will:
- Make KanaDojo accessible to more users worldwide
- Demonstrate commitment to internationalization
- Encourage community participation
- Serve as examples for future translations

## üìö References

- **Original README**: `README.md`
- **Example Translation**: `README.pt-br.md` (Portuguese Brazil)
- **Contributing Guide**: `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- **Issue Templates**: `TRANSLATION_ISSUES.md`
- **Creation Guide**: `CREATE_TRANSLATION_ISSUES.md`

## ‚ú® Expected Outcome

After creating these 4 issues:
- Contributors can self-select languages they're fluent in
- Clear guidelines ensure consistent, high-quality translations
- README becomes accessible to French, Spanish, Chinese, and German speakers
- Project demonstrates commitment to global accessibility
