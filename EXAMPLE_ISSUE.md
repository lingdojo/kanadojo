## GitHub Issue Preview

**Issue #XX: Translate README to French (France)**

🏷️ Labels: `documentation` `translation` `help wanted` `good first issue`

---

### 📝 Description

We need to translate the main `README.md` file into French (France) to make KanaDojo more accessible to French-speaking users.

### 🎯 Goal

Create a French translation of the README as `README.fr-fr.md` following the same structure and style as the existing English `README.md` and Portuguese `README.pt-br.md`.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create a new file named `README.fr-fr.md` in the root directory
- [ ] Translate all text content from `README.md` into French (France)
- [ ] Preserve all markdown formatting, links, and images
- [ ] Keep all code blocks, badges, and technical terms in their original form
- [ ] Maintain the same structure and sections as the original README
- [ ] Ensure technical terminology is accurately translated
- [ ] Keep the Japanese text (e.g., "KanaDojo かな道場", "がんばって！") unchanged
- [ ] Ensure cultural appropriateness for French (France) audience

### 📋 Sections to Translate

All sections of the README should be translated, including:
- About KanaDojo
- Key Features
- Screenshots (captions if any)
- UI & Design Philosophy
- Tech Stack (descriptions only, keep library names and technical terms)
- Getting Started
- Project Structure (comments)
- Contributing
- License
- Acknowledgments
- Contact & Links

### 💡 Translation Guidelines

- Use formal "vous" form or informal "tu" based on the community preference (recommend informal "tu" for learning platforms)
- Translate UI-related terms consistently (e.g., "dojo" might remain as "dojo" or be explained)
- Keep technical terms in English where appropriate (e.g., "Next.js", "React", "TypeScript")
- Ensure natural French language flow while maintaining technical accuracy
- Use proper French typography (e.g., spaces before punctuation marks like « : ; ! ? »)

### 🔗 References

- Original README: [`README.md`](README.md)
- Portuguese example: [`README.pt-br.md`](README.pt-br.md)

### 🤝 Notes for Contributors

- If you're a native French (France) speaker or fluent in French, this is a great contribution!
- Feel free to ask questions in the comments if you're unsure about any translation choices
- Consider reviewing the Portuguese translation to see how certain platform-specific terms were handled

## 💬 Example Comments (What might happen after issue creation)

**User @french-contributor commented:**
> Hi! I'm a native French speaker and I'd love to help with this translation. I'll start working on it this weekend!

**Maintainer @lingdojo commented:**
> That's great! Thank you @french-contributor! Please feel free to ask any questions as you work on the translation. Looking forward to your PR! 🇫🇷

**User @french-contributor commented:**
> Quick question: should I use "tu" or "vous" for addressing the user? The app seems to have an informal, friendly tone.

**Maintainer @lingdojo commented:**
> Good question! I think "tu" would be more appropriate given the casual, learning-focused nature of the app. But use your best judgment as a native speaker! 😊
