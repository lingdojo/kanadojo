        JLPT (short for Japanese-Language Proficiency Test) is a standardized
        criterion-referenced test to evaluate and certify Japanese language
        proficiency for non-native speakers.
        <br />
        The JLPT vocabulary lists categorize kanji characters and words based on
        their appearance in the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT). The
        test has five levels, from N5 (easiest) to N1 (most difficult), each
        requiring knowledge of a specific set of kanji. N5 and N4 focus on basic
        kanji and words used in day-to-day life, while N3, N2, and N1 introduce
        more complex and specialized characters and vocabulary. Originally
        designed for JLPT preparation, these vocabulary are also widely used by
        learners all over the world to study Japanese effectively and
        systematically.

    content: (
      <p className='text-lg text-[var(--secondary-color)]'>
        Word types categorize words based on their function and meaning in a
        sentence. Nouns name people, places, things, or ideas - like
        &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;city&quot;, &quot;happiness&quot;, and so on.
        Adjectives describe or modify nouns, giving details about certain
        qualities of a noun - like &quot;happy&quot;, &quot;beautiful&quot;,
        &quot;tall&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;. Verbs express actions, states, or
        occurrences - like &quot;run&quot;, &quot;think&quot;,
        &quot;exist&quot;. And finally, adverbs modify verbs, adjectives or even
        other adverbs, often indicating manner, time, or degree - like
        &quot;quickly&quot;, &quot;slowly&quot;, &quot;poorly&quot;,
        &quot;very&quot;, &quot;yesterday&quot;, and so on.
