          JLPT (short for Japanese-Language Proficiency Test) is a standardized
          criterion-referenced test to evaluate and certify Japanese language
          proficiency for non-native speakers.
          <br />
          The JLPT vocabulary lists categorize kanji characters and words based
          on their appearance in the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT).
          The test has five levels, from N5 (easiest) to N1 (most difficult),
          each requiring knowledge of a specific set of kanji. N5 and N4 focus
          on basic kanji and words used in day-to-day life, while N3, N2, and N1
          introduce more complex and specialized characters and vocabulary.
          Originally designed for JLPT preparation, these vocabulary are also
          widely used by learners all over the world to study Japanese
          effectively and systematically.

        <p className='text-lg text-[var(--secondary-color)]'>
          Word types categorize words based on their function and meaning in a

          &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;city&quot;, &quot;happiness&quot;, and so on.
          Adjectives describe or modify nouns, giving details about certain
          qualities of a noun - like &quot;happy&quot;, &quot;beautiful&quot;,
          &quot;tall&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;. Verbs express actions, states, or
          occurrences - like &quot;run&quot;, &quot;think&quot;,
          &quot;exist&quot;. And finally, adverbs modify verbs, adjectives or
          even other adverbs, often indicating manner, time, or degree - like
          &quot;quickly&quot;, &quot;slowly&quot;, &quot;poorly&quot;,
          &quot;very&quot;, &quot;yesterday&quot;, and so on.
